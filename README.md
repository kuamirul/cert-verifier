# Testing changes locally
You can [follow this guide](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/) for the full instructions. Below is an abbreviated version.

1. Run `gem install bundler`. You may need to prefix this with `sudo`.
2. Install all the dependencies (including Jekyll) with `bundle install`.
3. Run the site locally with `bundle exec jekyll serve`.

You should see the site running at [http://127.0.0.1:4000](http://127.0.0.1:4000). It'll pick up changes as you make them; just refresh the browser to see any updates you make.
